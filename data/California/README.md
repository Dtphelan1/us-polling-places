## California Polling Places (2012-2018)

This collection of polling locations in California contains 57,775 records. It covers general elections held from 2012 to 2018. It is drawn from 185 documents obtained via open records requests and research by the Center for Public Integrity. The records cover 53 of California's 58 counties.

### Caveats

Though a lot of effort went into producing a clean data set, errors almost certainly remain.

The files received were sometimes clean Excel documents, but often messy PDFs. The locations were sometimes incomplete, missing addresses or missing precinct identifiers. Reporters researched the addresses when possible, but gaps still remain.

Can you help us complete the polling locations for a county or spot an error? Pull requests or emails to data@publicintegity.org welcome.

### Coverage

The following is the record count for each county. Some records include multiple precincts that voted at one location (separated by commas), other counties list a location multiple times â€” once for each precinct that voted there.

If a county is listed as having "N/A" records in a particular year, it was generally either because we couldn't obtain documents showing the polling places or the documents we did obtain were unclear.

This dataset focuses on election day polling places, so early voting locations were excluded. Vote centers were included, but are currently not identified by type.
