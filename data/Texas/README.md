## Texas Polling Places (2012-2018)

This collection of polling locations in Texas contains 26,187 records. It covers general elections held from 2012 to 2018. It is drawn from 525 documents obtained via open records requests and research by the Center for Public Integrity. The records cover 253 of Texas's 254 counties.

### Caveats

Though a lot of effort went into producing a clean data set, errors almost certainly remain.

Much of election administration in Texas is overseen by local officials in small counties with few resources. Though many public officials went out of their way to be helpful, some struggled to find records from prior years, or gave their best approximation based on recollection. This data relies on their account.

The files received were sometimes clean Excel documents, but often messy Word documents or PDFs. The locations were sometimes incomplete, missing addresses or missing precinct identifiers. Reporters researched the addresses when possible, but gaps still remain.

Can you help us complete the polling locations for a county or spot an error? Pull requests or emails to data@publicintegity.org welcome.

### Coverage

The following is the record count for each county. Some records include multiple precincts that voted at one location (separated by commas), other counties list a location multiple times â€” once for each precinct that voted there.

If a county is listed as having "N/A" records in a particular year, it was generally either because we couldn't obtain documents showing the polling places or the documents we did obtain were unclear.

This dataset focuses on election day polling places, so early voting locations were excluded. Vote centers were included, but are currently not identified by type.
